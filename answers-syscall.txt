Looking at the backtrace output, which function called syscall? 
--> usertrap

What is the value of p->trapframe->a7 and what does that value represent? 
--> 7
--> SYS_exec

What was the previous mode that the CPU was in? 
--> user mode

Write down the assembly instruction the kernel is panicing at. Which register corresponds to the variable num?
--> num = *(int *)0;
    800020b6:	00002683          	lw	a3,0(zero) # 0 <_entry-0x80000000>
--> a3

Why does the kernel crash? Hint: look at figure 3-3 in the text; is address 0 mapped in the kernel address space? Is that confirmed by the value in scause above?
--> The kernel crash because of an error occurred while loading data from memory address 0 into s2
--> Address 0 is not mapped int the kernel space, it begins at address 0x800
--> Yes, that is confirmed by the value 13 in scause which represents a load page fault

What is the name of the binary that was running when the kernel paniced? What is its process id (pid)?
--> initcode
--> 1
